I finally figured out my problem: (on Win XP)

When I installed wamp, C: was not my root drive - my main drive was E:. 
Even though I changed the installation path to be E:\wamp 
I figured that some files in the E:\wamp\bin\apache\Apache2.2.21\conf\extra directory have hard coded paths on C:. 
Just replace them with the appropriate path on your installation drive. 
Check the httpd-autoindex, httpd-dav, httpd-multilang-errordoc, httpd-ssl, httpd-vhosts.

Then restart the apache service.

I hope this will help you.
